# Shell

This is a 2nd year university project in which I was tasked to create a shell prompt in C
My limited prototype contains the following commands:
- echo (prints the words following echo to console)
- environ (prints environment variables to console)
- clr (clears shell)
- pause (pauses prompt until the Enter key is pressed)
- quit (closes the prompt)
